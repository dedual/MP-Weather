# MP-Weather
 A weather app that integrates with OpenWeather.
 
# Instructions to run
Clone the repo into your local directory.

Also, if you plan to run this on your device, make sure there's an appropriate code signing team selected, etc. etc. 

## Attention
Since the app requires an OpenWeather API KEY, you **NEED** to add your own OpenWeather API key to your`secrets.xcconfig` file. The contents of the file are straightforward. 

```
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = <ENTER YOUR KEY HERE>
```
